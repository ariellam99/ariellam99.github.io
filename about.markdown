I'm Ari, a 24-year-old woman residing in Kansas City, Missouri, with a profound passion for healthy living, beauty, and technology. I believe in cherishing the unexpected moments that define life. While my childhood dream of becoming an interior designer evolved during high school, where I dual-enrolled in community college to explore home design, it was in the background – in Adobe and CAD classes – that I found true joy. The pandemic-induced furlough became a catalyst for reflection, prompting me to question what truly intrigued me. Recalling experiences from helping friends with technology to being fascinated with robots, a common thread emerged: a lifelong interest in science and technology.
Programming emerged as my truest art form, though as a woman, I initially felt like an imposter in the male-dominated STEM field. Despite this, I persevered, navigating the challenges of self-learning and overcoming doubts about pursuing a degree in computer science. It took over a year of delving into tutorials, exploring tech specializations, and grasping foundational concepts like logic and algorithms before deciding on my educational path. Another year passed before I officially enrolled, and now, as I reflect again, I realize my passion for technology extends beyond a degree.
I aspire to share my enthusiasm for the tech field with other women, breaking stereotypes and inspiring young girls who may hesitate to join robotics teams due to gender norms. My journey underscores my commitment to fostering inclusivity and encouraging diversity in STEM. I stand out in my field not just for my technical skills but for my resilience, determination, and dedication to empowering women in technology.
